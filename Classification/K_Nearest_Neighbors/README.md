KNN can be used to predict where would a particular value fit from the subset of different outcomes.

KNN follows the principle of LMS distance between 2 points also called the Euclidien distance. This is measured between the target point and its neighbours.

D = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)

Eg: So if K = 5, the closest 5 neihbours are checked for position/cluster in which they are present to fit the data point accordingly.

There are other distance formule' that can be used such as Manhattan.

** One of the most important factors for calculation is scaling of the data to avoid partial outcomes.
