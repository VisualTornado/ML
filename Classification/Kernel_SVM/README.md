Kernal SVM is a non-linear classifier that uses gaussian RBF/sigmoid/polynomial kernels, to visualize data to a higher dimension and then project it back in lower dimension once the non-linear boundary has been established.

The SVM uses a technique of forming a plane/line as a seprator with the support vectors(closest point to the other half) which are the maximum sepration points between different classes of data points.
