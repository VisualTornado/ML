Decision tree regression is a Non Linear Non Continous type of regression which splits data according to a alogorithm and calculates the average for each group of points which acts as o/p for any input in value depending on where that i/p belongs.

DRT predicts values based on the algorithm used to split the data set so each set of data points has 1 o/p value across its range giving a step curve graph.
